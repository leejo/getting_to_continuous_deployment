## Getting to Continuous Deployment

## Continuous Deployment?

"Continuous deployment (CD) is a strategy in software development where code changes to an application are released automatically into the production environment."

--

Simple!

???

This talk is more about all of the things you need in place before you even consider CD, it's not a talk about how to setup and configure all of the CD like things

I might show some of that at the end if we have time however

---

## Questions?

--

* Jot them down and if we have time at the end we can cover them

--

* Jot down the point number in the bottom right corner of the slide as well

---

## A Brief Introduction [to me]

--

* Backend/API developer

???

Perl, Python, Ruby, Bash, C (but rusty), etc

--

* Largely in the "payments" space

???

often backend bank integration kind of stuff

--

* I've been doing this for twenty years üò≥

???

but only worked for three companies in that time

so have seen tech stacks grow

--

* More in a site reliability engineering [SRE] role these days

--

* Often been involved on the deployment side of things

???

Including 3am starts - remember those?

wrote quite a few tools around this in current and previous jobs

--

* Pragmatist, not an idealist

---

## Quixotism?

*/kiÀêÀàho ät…™z…ôm/*

???

On that last point

--

* "Impracticality in pursuit of ideals...

--

* "... especially those ideals manifested by rash, lofty and romantic ideas"

--

* "... It also serves to describe an idealism without regard to practicality"

--

* Need to consider the practicality of getting to Continuous Deployment

---

## Practicality (Technical)?

--

* What state is your current deployment process in?

--

* Can you deploy all/some/no changes without a maintenance windows?

???

how often and how long are those maintenance windows?

--

* Do you need to babysit the deployment process?

--

 * Run commands/restart processes manually?
--

 * Apply DB updates manually?

--

* How's your monitoring?

--

 * How quickly do you know PROD is having issues?
--

 * Who gets alerted to that?

---

## Practicality (Human Side)?

--

* I don't want to be woken up because someone merged something to `main` at X o'clock CET

???

with distributed teams/devs those merges can happen

--

 * I like to have my weekends free of work stuff

--

 * Friday evening is part of my weekend...

--

* FAANG's site reliability engineering [SRE] teams are probably bigger than your entire IT department

???

FAANG: Facebook (now Meta Platforms), Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google

--

 * By an order of magnitude

--

 * They effectively have 24/7 SRE coverage

???

you probably do not

---

## Practicality (Human Side)?


* PROD will have issues even when you make no changes

--

 * Especially in "cloud" environments

???

"failure modes in cloud computing" is a entire other talk

i've been collecting these so might give that talk one day

--

* So by association CD can never be risk free

--

 * "This change can't possibly have any impact"

--

 * I disagree

--

* You're going to lose an evening or weekend at some point even with no deployments

--

 * So reduce the chance of that happening

???

when are the most PROD outages? when devs are in the office deploying changes

---

## Our Infrastructure (PROD)

--

Long before I joined (early years, mid 2000s)

--

* A single server sat in an office somewhere in Stellenbosch

???

pretty easy to deploy to that

root on everything as well

---

## Our Infrastructure (PROD)

When I joined (mid 2013):

![:scale 50%](infra_diagrams/aws_region.png)

???

There's a tonne of stuff i haven't put in here

the bits in orange are the ones of concern: what we deploy code to

---

## Our Infrastructure (PROD)

Current situation (mid 2023)

![:scale 50%](infra_diagrams/aws_regions.png)

???

also added daemon servers

---

## Our Infrastructure (PROD)

--

* Deploy to: web servers, batch server, daemon server(s)

--

* Autoscaling (Web and Daemon servers)

 * Quietest case: c. 20 servers to deploy code to

 * Busiest case: *at least* 100 servers to deploy code to

 * Spread across 4 different AWS regions

???

I consider this large enough to mean automated deployment is necessary, but small enough where automated deployment can cause problems

if you have thousands of severs you can do a rolling release and stop then rollback when you identify problems

if you only have dozens or hundreds then you may well have finished rolling out a problematic deployment before you realise it is problematic

--

* Minimum threshold for automated deployment is probably 1 server anyway

---

## Our Infrastructure (PROD)

--

* Deployment started as tarballs

???

When it was just one or two servers

--

* Then bash scripts

???

When we were in one region

--

* Now a Perl script that is configuration driven

???

When i started to get annoyed by the bash scripts and we added more regions

--

* Future aim is containerisation so images/containers/whatever

???

At which point the toolchain will need refactoring/replacing

---

## Getting To Continuous Deployment?

--

* What are the things you need in place before you even *think* about CD?

--

* How do they help?

--

* How do they hinder?

---

## You Need: Consistency Through Your Environments

--

* Same version of Perl (currently 5.32 for us)

--

 * With the same versions of the libraries

--

* Same version of the Operating System

--

 * With the same versions of critical dependencies

???

e.g. PDF generation

--

* This goes for DEV all the way through to PROD

--

 * Write once run everywhere is nice in theory

--

 * Until you need to run `strace` to figure out a regression

---

## You Need: Comprehensive Automated Testing

--

* Goes without saying?

???

Yet i still see significant changes that lack test coverage

ramble about this a bit...

legacy? might not have tests

third parties? difficult, need emulators, etc

--

* Adding tests has a large negative impact on velocity

--

 * At least in the short to medium term

--

* It should become a large positive impact in the long term

--

 * If you do it right

--

* There's no such thing as a one line or one character change

--

 * Unless that change is only in the test

---

## You Need: Continuous Integration (CI)

--

* You need tests for this (see previous slide)

--

* CI needs its own infrastructure

--

* How easily can you build that up and tear it down?

--

* How close does it represent PROD?

--

* Failures in the CI pipeline are sometimes failures in the toolchain

--

* But false negatives (failures) are better than false positives (passes) in CI

???

A CI suite falsely passing is obviously bad

---

## You Need: A Review and Quality Assurance [QA] Process

--

* Anything that can be automated here should be in the test stage

--

 * Linting, etc

--

* Formalise the review process and apply to all merge requests

--

 * With good judgement to allow exceptions

---

## You Need: Staging

--

* For the bigger changes

--

* Part of the review process

--

* For UAT from clients

--

* This may inform the release process if it's not a trivial set of changes

---

## You Need: An Internal Toolchain

--

* Deployment scripts

--

* Schema migrations and updates

--

* Repo management (if big enough)

--

* Monitoring

--

* Alerting

---

## You Need: An "External" Toolchain

--

* You will rely on tools built outside your company

--

* Choose wisely, couple loosely

--

* Gitlab

--

* AWS

--

* Monitoring

* Alerting

---

## You Need: A Rollback Feature

--

* Built into the deployment process

--

* We tag every release to each region

--

* We annotate monitoring dashboards with releases

--

* We can rollback to previous releases trivially

--

* If you do release frequently this is (in theory) easier

---

## You Need: To Think About The Database / Complex Deployments?

--

* Feature flags

--

* Still have to babysit significant schema changes

--

* Write them in a "no downtime" approach if possible

--

* Backwards and forwards compatible

???

and then remove the backwards compatible parts after rolling forwards

--

* Deploy them during quiet periods of the month?

---

## You Need: Checking Once Changes Hit Production

--

* How do the original developers *know* it has been deployed?

???

we send notifications to Slack and email

--

* How do you verify those changes?

???

internal accounts / test users clearly

---

## You Need: Continuously Deploy All The Internal Things First

--

* A good proof of concept

--

* Internal tools *probably* don't affect the bottom line.

--

 * Internal tools breaking for a short time isn't critical
 * At least not immediately, that is to say no customer impact

???

If it's internally facing only you can probably use CD and not worry about the short-term consequences... maybe?

--

* Encourages development of the toolchain

---

## How Far Have *We* Got?

--

We have full CD on internal tools:

--

 * Translation manager
 * DB extract/backup scripts
 * The deployment scripts themselves (meta!)

???

describe each one

--

* We have Semi CD elsewhere

---

## Semi-Continuous Deployment?

* One click "deploy to everywhere" is a nice compromise?

--

## Semi-Continuous Deployment?

* One click "deploy to everywhere" is a nice compromise?

![:scale 100%](img/09_pipeline_deployed.png)

---

## Semi-Continuous Deployment?

* One click "deploy to everywhere" is a nice compromise?

![:scale 75%](img/10_deployment_output.png)

---

## Questions or Bonus "Slides" (i.e. Demo)?

???

bonus slides show:

* pipelines

* gitlab CI

* gitlab CD

* grafana dashboards with annotations

* slack channel with deployment info
